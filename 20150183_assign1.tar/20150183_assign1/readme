Assignment number 1

Spent time = 25~30 hour

I did this assignment last semester.
(Actually, I dropped EE209 before the mid term.)
Actually, it was still hard for me, but, I solved lots of bugs

Most of all, this time, my algorithm is different from past of mine.
I learned a lot of things by this assignment. I learned how to make
better algorithm (actually, I still have to know this thing, ha ha)

I think this assignment is too complicated, because we have to use
a lot of if, while statement.
