1. precept and lecutre helped me to do this assignment a lot.
2. hash table was much faster than linked list, actually in searching.
   This result is came by test code, specifically, getsumcustomerpurchase
   includes searching algorithm. at this time, hash table was really fast.
   I think hash table is better than linked list in every side, actually.
   Just 1 thing which linked list is better is the time which costs to
   make code. :D
3. I did hash table expansion in growhash function, in customer_manager2.c
4. I spent time similar to assignment 2. It didn't took a lot.
5. I could understand hash table and linked list. It was really nice.
