Assignment 6


-- I did this assignment individually.

-- There are some of mistakes and errors.

1. my makefile works if there are no *.o files in my directory. However, if I modify some codes, it says some of messages, such as undefined reference to ~~~. However, execution file works. I cannot know why this happens. I mailed to YoungGyoun Moon, but I could not solve this problem.

2. Pipe does not work, so if the message contains pipe, it leads to segmentation fault.
   *IMPORTANT*
   Because pipe doesn't work, if I get input from .ishrc, it goes to the infinite loop at
   	   ls -al | grep drw
	   
   So, I think when you try to grade my code, you should reject all of pipe scores, and other testing codes should not contain pipe element.
   (However, my code determines whether | is the special character or just filename.)
